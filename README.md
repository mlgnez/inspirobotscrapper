Gets random quotes from InspiroBot and puts them in a folder for easy viewing. Made this for fun while procrastinating schoolwork.

--- HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK ---

On line 66, "File file = new File("");" put the address / path of the folder into the quotation marks (tried using a variable but that didn't work idk why)

The variable "times" is the amount of images downloaded.

Have fun with the random quotes from InspiroBot.
